# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the pilfer project.

## Workflows

### ðŸš€ `ci.yml` - Quick CI
**Purpose**: Fast, essential testing on every push/PR

**What it does**:
- Tests on Python 3.11 with Ubuntu latest
- Runs the unified test suite
- Verifies standalone script works
- Completes in ~2-3 minutes

**When to use**: This is the primary workflow for most development work.

### ðŸ”¬ `test.yml` - Comprehensive Test Suite  
**Purpose**: Thorough testing, code quality, and security scanning

**What it does**:
- **Multi-Python Testing**: Tests on Python 3.8-3.12
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, isort import sorting, flake8 linting
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit security analysis, safety dependency check
- **Test Coverage**: Coverage reports with HTML output
- **Fail-safe**: Continues testing other versions even if one fails
- **Debugging**: Runs individual test classes if main tests fail

**When to use**: 
- Before releases
- For thorough validation of major changes
- When you want comprehensive analysis

## Triggers

Both workflows trigger on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branches
- Manual dispatch (via GitHub UI)

## Best Practices Implemented

### âœ… **Security**
- Pinned action versions (e.g., `@v4`, `@v3`)
- Minimal permissions (default is read-only)
- Dependency scanning with safety
- Code security analysis with bandit

### âœ… **Performance**
- Dependency caching for faster builds
- Parallel job execution
- Strategic use of `fail-fast: false`

### âœ… **Reliability**
- Matrix testing across Python versions
- Conditional steps (e.g., debug steps only on failure)
- Artifact preservation for investigation

### âœ… **Observability**
- Clear job and step names
- Detailed error output
- Coverage and security reports as artifacts

## Viewing Results

### Status Badges
Add to your README.md:
```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pilfer/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pilfer/actions)
[![Test Suite](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pilfer/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pilfer/actions)
```

### Artifacts
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML coverage reports from test-coverage job
- **Security Reports**: JSON reports from bandit and safety scans

## Local Development

To run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Quick test (same as ci.yml)
cd tests && python run_tests.py

# Code formatting
black --check pilfer/ pilfer.py tests/
isort --check-only pilfer/ pilfer.py tests/
flake8 pilfer/ pilfer.py tests/ --max-line-length=100

# Security scanning  
bandit -r pilfer/ pilfer.py
safety check

# Coverage
cd tests
coverage run --source=../pilfer run_tests.py
coverage report
coverage html
```

## Customization

### Enable/Disable Jobs
Comment out jobs in `test.yml` you don't need:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    # ... always keep this
  # lint:
  #   # ... comment out to disable
  # security:  
  #   # ... comment out to disable
```

### Add More Python Versions
Edit the matrix in `test.yml`:
```yaml
matrix:
  python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
```

### Different Triggers
Modify the `on` section to change when workflows run:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]  # Add more branches
    tags: [ "v*" ]              # Run on version tags
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'         # Weekly on Mondays at 2 AM
```
